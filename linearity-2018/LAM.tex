We now introduce the Commutative/Non-commutative (CNC) logic in the
form of a term assignment.  One should view this logic as composed of
two logics one sitting to the left of the other.  On the left there is
intuitionistic linear logic, denoted by $\cat{C}$, and on the right is
the Lambek calculus denoted by $\cat{L}$.  Then we connect these two
systems by a pair of monoidal adjoint functors $\cat{C} : \func{F}
\dashv \func{G} : \cat{L}$.  Keeping this intuition in mind we now
define the syntax for CNC logic.
\begin{definition}
  \label{def:Lambek-syntax}
  The following grammar describes the syntax of CNC logic:

        & \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\mid [[appl s1 s2]] \mid [[appr s1 s2]] \mid [[F t]]\\

        \text{($\cat{L}$-Patterns)} & [[p]] ::= [[trivSp]] \mid [[x (>) y]] \mid [[F p]]\\        
        \text{($\cat{C}$-Contexts)} & [[I]],[[P]] ::= [[.]] \mid [[x : X]] \mid [[I,P]]\\
        \text{($\cat{L}$-Contexts)} & [[G]],[[D]] ::= [[.]] \mid [[x : A]] \mid [[x : X]] \mid [[G;D]]\\        
        \text{($\cat{C}$-Typing Judgment)} & [[I |-c t : X]]\\
        \text{($\cat{L}$-Typing Judgment)} & [[G |-l s : A]]\\
      \end{array}
    \end{math}
  \end{center}
\end{definition}

The syntax for $\cat{C}$-types are the standard types for
intuitionistic linear logic.  We have a unit $[[UnitT]]$, tensor
product $[[X (*) Y]]$, and linear implication $[[X -o Y]]$, but just
as in LNL logic we also have a type $[[Gf A]]$, where $[[A]]$ is an
$\cat{L}$-type, that is, a type from the non-commutative side,
corresponding to the right-adjoint functor between $\cat{L}$ and
$\cat{C}$ which can be used to import types and terms from the
non-commutative side into the commutative side.  Now $\cat{C}$-typing
judgments are denoted by $[[P |-c t : X]]$ where $[[P]]$ is a sequence
of pairs of variables and their types, denoted by $[[x : X]]$, $[[t]]$
is a $\cat{C}$-term, and $[[X]]$ is a $\cat{C}$-type.  The
$\cat{C}$-terms are all standard, but $[[Gf s]]$ which corresponds to
the morphism part of the right-adjoint of the adjunction between both
logics, and $[[ex t1 , t2 with x1 , x2 in t3]]$ which is the
introduction form for the structural rule exchange.

The non-commutative side is a bit more interesting than the
commutative side just introduced.  The $\cat{L}$-typing judgment has
the form $[[G |-l s : A]]$ where $[[G]]$ is now a $\cat{L}$-context,
denoted by $[[G]]$ or $[[D]]$, which are ordered sequences of pairs of
free variables with their types from \emph{both} sides denoted by $[[x
    : B]]$ and $[[x : X]]$, $[[s]]$ is a $\cat{L}$-term, and $[[A]]$
is a $\cat{L}$-type.  Given two typing contexts $[[G]]$ and $[[D]]$ we
denote their concatenation by, $[[G;D]]$, we use a semicolon here to
emphasize the fact that the contexts are ordered.

The context consisting of hypotheses from both sides goes back to
Benton~\cite{Benton:1994} and is a property unique to adjoint logics
such as Benton's LNL logic and CNC logic.  This is also a very useful
property because it allows one to make use of both sides within the
Lambek calculus without the need to annotate every formula with a
modality.

The reader familiar with LNL logic will notice that our
typing judgment, $[[G |-l s : A]]$, differs from Benton's which is of
the form $\Gamma;\Delta \vdash t : A$ where $\Gamma$ contains
non-linear formulas, and $\Delta$ contains linear formulas.  Just as
Benton remarks, the splitting of his contexts was a presentational
device, and one should view his contexts as merged, and hence, linear
formulas were fully mixed with non-linear formulas.  Now why did we
not use this presentational device?  Because, when contexts from LNL
logic became out of order Benton could use the exchange rule to put
them back in order again, but we no longer have general exchange, and
hence, we are not able to keep the context organized in this way.

The syntax for $\cat{L}$-types are of
the typical form for the Lambek Calculus.  We have an unit type
$[[UnitS]]$, a non-commutative tensor product $[[A (>) B]]$, right
implication $[[A -> B]]$, and left implication $[[B <- A]]$.
$\cat{L}$-terms correspond to introduction and elimination forms for
each of the previous types.  For example, $[[s1 (>) s2]]$ introduces a
tensor, and $[[let s1 : A (>) B be x (>) y in s2]]$ eliminates a
tensor.

The typing rules for CNC logic can be found in Figure.
