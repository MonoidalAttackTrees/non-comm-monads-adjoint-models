We now introduce the Lambek Calculus in the form of a term assignment
for intuitionistic linear logic, but in LNL style.
\begin{definition}
  \label{def:Lambek-syntax}
  The following grammar describes the syntax of the adjoint
  formalization of the Lambek Calculus:
  \begin{center}\vspace{-10px}
    \begin{math}
      \begin{array}{lll}
        \text{(NC Types)} & [[A]],[[B]],[[C]],[[DT]] ::= [[UnitS]] \mid [[A (>) B]] \mid [[A -> B]] \mid [[B <- A]] \mid [[F X]]\\
        \text{(CM Types)} & [[W]],[[X]],[[Y]],[[Z]] ::= [[UnitT]] \mid [[X (x) Y]] \mid [[X -o Y]] \mid [[Gf A]]\\
        \text{(NC Terms)} & [[s]] ::= [[x]] \mid [[trivS]] \mid [[s1 (>) s2]] \mid [[let s1 : A be p in s2]] \mid [[\l x : A.s]] \mid [[\r x : A . s]] \mid [[appl s1 s2]] \mid [[appr s1 s2]] \\
        & \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\mid [[F t]] \mid [[let t : X be q in s]]\\
        \text{(CM Terms)} & [[t]] ::= [[x]] \mid [[trivT]] \mid [[t1 (X) t2]] \mid [[let t1 : X be q in t2]] \mid [[\x:X.t]] \mid [[t1 t2]] \mid [[ex t1 , t2 with x1 , x2 in t3]] \mid [[Gf s]]\\
        \text{(NC Patterns)} & [[p]] ::= [[trivSp]] \mid [[x (>) y]] \mid [[F p]]\\
        \text{(CM Patterns)} & [[q]] ::= [[trivTp]] \mid [[x (X) y]] \mid [[Gf q]]\\
        \text{(NC Contexts)} & [[G]],[[D]] ::= [[.]] \mid [[x : A]] \mid [[x : X]] \mid [[G;D]]\\
        \text{(CM Contexts)} & [[I]],[[P]] ::= [[.]] \mid [[x : X]] \mid [[I,P]]\\
        \text{(NC Typing Judgment)} & [[G |-l s : A]]\\
        \text{(CM Typing Judgment)} & [[I |-c t : X]]\\
      \end{array}
    \end{math}
  \end{center}
\end{definition}

The syntax for types are of the typical form for the Lambek Calculus.
We have an atomic type $[[Base]]$, the unit type $[[Unit]]$, a
non-commutative tensor product $[[A (>) B]]$, right implication $[[A
    -> B]]$, and left implication $[[B <- A]]$.  Terms correspond to
introduction and elimination forms for each type.  For example, $[[t1
    (>) t2]]$ introduces a tensor, and $[[let t1 : A (>) B be x (>) y
    in t2]]$ eliminates a tensor.  Typing context, $[[G]]$, are
ordered sequences of pairs of free variables with their types denoted
by $[[x : A]]$.  Given two typing contexts $[[G]]$ and $[[D]]$ we
denote their concatenation by, $[[G;D]]$, we use a semicolon here to
emphasize the fact that the contexts are ordered.

One of the most interesting aspects of the Lambek Calculus is that it
contains two implications, $[[A -> B]]$ and $[[B <- A]]$, but why is
that?  Typically, implication is introduced from knowing $[[G;x : A |-
    t : B]]$ holds, but what about $[[x : A;G |- t : B]]$?  These
happen to be different in the Lambek Calculus, because, as we say
above, contexts are ordered.  However, we need to be able to discharge
both of the assumptions, $[[x : A]]$, thus leading to requiring two
implications.
