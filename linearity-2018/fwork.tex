We introduce the idea above of having a modality for exchange, but
what about a individual modalities for weakening and contraction?
Indeed it is possible to give modalities for these structural rules as
well using adjoint models.  Now that we have each structural rule
isolated into their own modality is it possible to put them together
to form new modalities that combine structural rules?  The answer to
this question has already been show to be positive, at least for
weakening and contraction, but we plan to extend this line of work to
include exchange.  Jacobs~\cite{JACOBS199473} used monads and
distributive laws to relate modalities, but
Melli{\'e}s~\cite{Mellies:2004} shows how to use adjunctions to
accomplish the same, but in a more intuitive and natural way.

The monads induced by the adjunction in CNC logic is non-commutative,
but Benton and Wadler show that the monads induced by the adjunction
in LNL logic \cite{Benton:1996} are commutative.  Using the extension
of Melli{\'e}s work we mention above would allow us to combine both
CNC logic with LNL logic, and then be able to support both commutative
monads as well as non-commutative monads.  We plan on exploring this
in the future.
