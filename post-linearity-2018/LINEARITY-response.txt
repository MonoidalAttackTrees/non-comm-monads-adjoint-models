> The paper seems as a good contribution to the development of the research in Lambek Calculus and its extensions and in Non Commutative Linear Logic.  The results seem accurate and well presented.  The authors have a very good experience in this field. It would be interesting to compare this work with Non Commutative Logic introduced by Abrusci and Ruet: but in the paper no  reference is made to Noncommutative Logic, and to a very long discussion (inside the community of researchers in Noncommutative linear logic, on the possible use of exchange modality to replace exchange rule.

> Lambek Calculus is presented in the paper in a non correct way, since the rules for right implication "A-->B" and the left implication "B>--A" are erroneously formulated. On page 3,
> - in right rule of right implication the last hypothesis is discharged (whereas in Lambek calculus the first hypothesis is discharged in this rule),
> - the left rule of right implication  gives a modus ponies in the form "A-->B, A |-B", whereas in lambek Calculus the modus ponies for right implication is "A, A-->B |-B"
> - in right rule of left implication the first hypothesis is discharged (whereas in Lambek calculus the last hypothesis is discharged in this rule),
> - the left rule of left implication  gives a modus ponies in the form "A, B<--A |-B", whereas in Lambek Calculus the modus ponies for right implication is " B<-- A, A |-B".
> The publication of the paper presuppose the elimination of these errors.
