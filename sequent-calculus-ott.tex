The term assignment for sequent calculus of the commutative part of the model, i.e. the SMCC of
the adjunction, is defined in Figure~\ref{fig:elle-smcc}. And the term assignme for the
non-commutative part, i.e. the Lambek category of the adjunction, is defined in
Figure~\ref{fig:elle-lambek}. $\Psi$ and $\Phi$ are contexts for the non-commutative part
and they are lists. $\Gamma$ and $\Delta$ are contexts for the commutative part and they are
multisets, therefore the following exchange rules are implicit.
